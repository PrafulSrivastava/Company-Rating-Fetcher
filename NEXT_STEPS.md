# Next Steps Backlog

1. **Implement Caching in Extension**
   - Cache fetched ratings in local storage to avoid redundant API calls and improve performance on repeated hovers.

2. **Add MutationObserver for Dynamic Content**
   - Use a MutationObserver to detect and handle dynamically loaded company links on LinkedIn pages (e.g., after navigation or scrolling).

3. **Integrate Additional Rating Sources**
   - Expand backend and extension to include more sources (e.g., Comparably, Levels.fyi) for richer company rating data.

4. **Package and Version the Extension**
   - Prepare the extension for distribution: bundle scripts, update manifest, add icons, and increment version numbers.

5. **Publish to Chrome Web Store**
   - Follow Chrome Web Store guidelines to submit, review, and publish the extension for public use.
